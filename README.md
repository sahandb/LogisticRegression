# Logistic Regression
Implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch for a classification task on the Iris dataset.

Iris is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning literature and is available in the UCI repository.

• The Iris dataset consists of 4 features and 3 classes. I used only the first and second features (remove the third and fourth columns) and also delete the instances of the ’Iris-versicolor’ class to reduce the data to 2 classes with 2 features.

• Considered the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test.
